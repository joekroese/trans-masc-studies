秋瑾 / Qiu Jin (1875-1907) was a Chinese writer & poet, a strong-willed feminist who is considered a national hero in China. Also called Jianhu Nüxia (Woman Knight of Mirror Lake), she was executed after participating in a failed uprising against the Qing Dynasty.

Qiu Jin was born into gentry in the southern port city of Xiamen. She had a comfortable childhood, but was forced to bind her feet, learn needlework and submit to an arranged marriage. In 1903, seven years after marrying, she moved with her family from Hunan to Beijing.

Here, she met like-minded women and began to take an interest in China’s political affairs. She unbound her feet, drank copious amounts of wine and began experimenting with cross-dressing and swordplay. In the summer of 1904, Qiu, then 28, left her husband and two children, sold her jewelry and sailed for Japan.

In Tokyo, Qiu enrolled at Shimoda Utako’s Women’s Practical School where she connected with other reform-minded Chinese students similarly keen on fomenting revolution back home and joined influential anti-Manchu secret societies.

She came back to China in 1906 aiming to advance women’s causes and topple the Qing government. She started the short-lived “Chinese Women’s Journal,” which used vernacular language to appeal to a broader audience on topics like the cruelty of foot-binding and arranged marriages. She also learned how to make bombs.

By 1907, Qiu was running the Datong School, a front for a group that recruited and trained young revolutionaries in Shaoxing. She learned that Xu Xilin, who was her friend and the school’s founder, had been executed for assassinating his Manchu superior.

After Xu’s death, friends warned Qiu that Qing troops were coming to Shaoxing to find the woman thought to be Xu’s co-conspirator. But Qiu refused to run away. In a scene that has since been embellished in a multitude of forms, Qiu attempted to fight back but was quickly captured, tortured and beheaded.

The following are quotes from ‘[Personal Matters: Women's Autobiographical Practice in Twentieth-century China](https://www.abebooks.co.uk/9780804750059/Personal-Matters-Womens-Autobiographical-Practice-080475005X/plp)’ by Lingzhen Wang (2004) that I thought were interesting re: her cross dressing and thoughts about the gendered body.

"Inscription on My Own Photo (In men's clothing)

Who is this person, starting at me so sternly?

The martial bones from a former existence regret their female embodiement. 

The flesh of this world is from the start a deception,

The land of the future, surely, is real

You and I should have been together long ago, to share out feelings;

Looking out and lamenting these difficult times, our spirits garner strength. 

When you see my friends from the old days,

Tell them I've scrubbed off all the old mud"
