Ashihara Kuniko - 葦原邦子 (December 16, 1912 - March 13, 1997) was a Japanese actor born in Hyogo prefecture. Kuniko was an otokoyaku, meaning she played male roles in in plays without cis male performers. It seems like she was quite political — fan-led wiki Takawiki states that she was an opponent of war and nuclear weapons until she passed away in 1997. Kuniko performed with the Takarazuka Review, an \~all female\~ theatre company. She was one of the first otokoyaku to wear her hair short, rather than hiding it under hats etc. It’s suggested on the Takarazuka Review wiki that this might have caused a bit of a scandal.

Takarazuka and homosexuality in Japanese society:

'After the scandal of women writing love letters to the _otokoyaku_ and the revelation of an actual lesbian relationship between a _otokoyaku_ and a _musumeyaku,_ the revue greatly limited itself in order to do away with the lesbian image. Women wore militaristic uniforms, heightening the attraction even more among some audience goers. There was another scandal in 1932 when, for the first time, one of the _otokoyaku_ cut her hair short (previously all of the actresses had their hair long and the _otokoyaku_ simply hid their hair under hats). In August 1940, the actresses were even forbidden to answer fan mail and socialize with their admirers. In the years since then, the regulations have relaxed but not by much.' - [Takarazuka Revue Wikipedia Page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takarazuka_Revue)
