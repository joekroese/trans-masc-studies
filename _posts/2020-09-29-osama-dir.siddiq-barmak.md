Osama (2003, dir Siddiq Barmak) is inspired by a true story, a tale which centres on three generations of women, deeply affected by the advent of the Taliban's rule in their land. Golbahari, a 12-year-old Afghan girl and her mother lose their jobs when this new regime closes the hospital where they work. As the Taliban has already begun to take over Afghanistan, the country's women find themselves forbidden to leave their houses without a 'legal companion'--specifically, a boy or a man. With both her husband and brother dead, there is no one left to support the family--and without being able to leave the house, this mother is left with nowhere to turn. Feeling that she has no other choice, the mother--along with the grandmother--disguises her daughter, Golbahari, as a boy. Now called Osama, the girl embarks on a terrifying and confusing journey as she tries to keep the Taliban from finding out her true identity.
