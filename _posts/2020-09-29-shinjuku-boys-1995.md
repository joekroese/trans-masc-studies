Shinjuku Boys (1995, dir. Kim Longinotto and Jano Williams). Shinjuku Boys introduces three onnabes (trans men) who work as hosts at the New Marilyn Club in Tokyo. As the film follows them at home and on the job, all three talk frankly to the camera about their gender-bending lives, revealing their views about women, sex, transvestitism and lesbianism. Alternating with these illuminating interviews are sequences shot inside the Club, visited almost exclusively by heterosexual women who have become disappointed with real men. It can be found on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzGDvtWByrU&ab_channel=ANTROPOLOGIAVISUALUFF) and [kanopy.com](http://kanopy.com), which can be accessed through some library memberships.

Suggested by @cruisingdystopia on the last post about Ashihara Kuniko. Longinotto and Williams worked on a film called Dream Girls (1993) before making Shinjuku Boys, which was about the Takarazuka Revue in which Kunkio had worked many years before. Dream Girls is also available on youtube!
