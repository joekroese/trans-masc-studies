Averies by Avery Jasper Powell and Avery John Porch, printed in the Winter 2002 issue of Transgender Tapestry.

‘I would spend hours online finding all the tangible things about transition, but what I was lacking, and still am at times, is someone who can talk to me transmit to transboi about all of life’s things that feel messed up during transition, like age and race and love and sex and body and emotions. I wanted to know those personal things that you can never find in pictures and on websites. I wanted to have that face to face connection with someone who had been there.’

Founded by Merissa Sherrill Lynn, Transgender Tapestry was a magazine published from the late 1970s to the early 2000s by the Tiffany Club and later by the International Foundation for Gender Education (IFGE). The publication went through several names changes including "The TV-TS Tapestry," "Tapestry," and "The Tapestry Journal."
