Nancy Morris (1893 - 1988, b. Wales) was a butch lesbian, contemporaries with the Sackville-Wests, Jean Cocteau, Virginia Woolf, Gluck, and Marlene Dietrich. Though little is known of her life, Francesca Wade has done a great job in [‘A Collar, A Tie and an Eton Crop: Who Was Nancy Morris?’](https://www.frieze.com/article/collar-tie-and-eton-crop-who-was-nancy-morris) piecing together information. Here are some of my favourite quotes. 

'In July 1930, a ‘Great Hermaphrodite’-themed party was held at Knole, the Kent estate belonging to the Sackville-West family. The evening, Bloomsbury chronicler Frances Partridge recorded in her diary, was somewhat disconcerting: the men had ‘loaded themselves with pearls, powder and paint’, and she felt out-of-place in her yellow silk dress when other women were wearing tuxedos. The atmosphere, she wrote, ‘was stifling and the noise so deafening that even the music from a vast gramophone horn was inaudible’. Partridge felt alienated by the ‘continuous passionate dancing’, which left her feeling ‘like a jelly that had only partly set’; she concluded that the party – hosted by Eddy Sackville-West and Nancy Morris – had been a failure.'

'\[Maggi\] Hambling remembers Nancy as ‘an old-style dyke with a collar and tie and an Eton crop’: she told me a story of Nancy in Paris in the 1920s, storming out of a salon to the astonishment of several gentlemen hairdressers. She had asked for ‘un coup d’homme’ – a men’s haircut or, to them, slang for ‘a fuck’.'

'But I found her again \[…\] There, suddenly, large as life, was a middle-aged Nancy, running a bookshop with her present lover, content to entertain customers with stories of life on the Left Bank, of partying with Marlene Dietrich and taking opium with Jean Cocteau. ‘My spare time I spend with the Lesbians,’ Mortimer wrote to the poet Michael Hamburger. ‘They are very rich and give me champagne \[…\] They wear death’s head sunglasses which give, even on the greyest days, an impression of heat. When they give parties they wear black silk men’s evening dress \[…\] I lie on their sofa and purr.’
