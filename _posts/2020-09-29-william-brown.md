William Brown, sailor, b. circa 1794. These images are records of the work of William Brown, a black sailor who served in the Royal Navy for over eleven years. In 1815, ages 21, Brown was discharged from the Queen Charlotte on the grounds of ‘being a female’, as shown in the second image. I’ve struggled to find any information on Brown beyond these fragments shared by @blackbritishfigures, let me know if any of you know anything else about this person! Below is a transcript of the text from the Annual Register for clarity — content warning for racist description of Brown’s appearance. I’ve also tried to neaten up the muster lists so you can see the writing clearer but honestly I can’t decipher most of it — just right of the spine it says the reason for discharge is ‘on being a female’.

‘Amongst the crew of the Queen Charlotte, 110 guns, recently paid off, it is now discovered, was a female African, who has serves as a seaman in the royal navy for upwards of eleven years, several of which she has been rated able on the books of the above ship by the name of William Brown, and has served for some time as the captain of the fore-tip, highly to the satisfaction of the officers. She is a smart well formed-figure, about five feet four inches in height, possessed for considerable strength and great activity ; her features are rather handsome for a black, and she appears to be about 26 years of age. Her share of prize money is said to be considerable, respecting which she has been several times within the last few days at Somerset-place. In her manner she exhibits all the traits of a British tar, and takes her grog with her late messmates with the greatest gaiety. She says she is a married woman; and went to sea in consequence of a quarrel with her husband, who, it is said, has entered a caveat against her receiving her prize money. She declares her intention of again entering the service as a volunteer. — Annual Register, 1815.
