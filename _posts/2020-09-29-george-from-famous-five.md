George from the Famous Five, written by Enid Blyton, first published in 1942.

George asks that people call her George rather than Georgina, cut her hair very short, and dresses in \~masculine\~ clothes. She is headstrong, courageous by nature, and has a hot and fiery temper.

George has a loyal dog named Timmy who would do anything for her. She often gets cross when anyone calls her by her real name or makes fun of Timmy, and she loves it when people call her George or mistake her for a boy. In some books, she asks that her name be prefixed with Master instead of Miss.

‘February 26, 2017 – Beth says: I believe that George was transgender, due to how strongly she objected whenever anyone called her a girl. Correct me if I'm wrong, but if a girl is simply a tomboy, they're perfectly happy to be identified as a girl, as they know they are and don't object to this- they simply act more like a boy, such as taking part in activities normally associated with males and not wearing "girly" clothes like dresses and skirts. The fact that George felt so offended whenever anyone called her a girl and was so pleased when new people thought she was a boy suggests that she was, in fact, transgender and fully identified as male’ — Beth, ‘Famous Five - George’s Feelings’ forum on enidblyton.net
