team:
- 4 students
stack:
contribution:
- We built a fully functioning lego chess robot that would complete a move in less than 2 minutes.
- After researching different solutions to read the chess board, the most reliable would be for the user to push down the pieces on a board with switches.  We built the custom wooden board with 64 switches, one under each square, the board would output 1 of 64 different possible voltage levels that the computer would read.
- An open source chess playing engine was used, given the move it would send it instructions to the lego mindstorms controller on the piece to move.  It supported killing pieces by first removing the target piece, castling, en passant.

Thank you for supporting the justice for Tony McDade campaign. My stats say over seven hundred people signed the petition through the link in this page’s bio. I’ve now replaced it with a link for donations that will split each contribution across a number of organisations that fight racism and police brutality in the US. It would be great if those seven hundred clicks became seven hundred dollars. White followers, please donate if you haven’t already. It’s time to put our money where our mouth is.
