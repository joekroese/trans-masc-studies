Thank you for supporting the justice for Tony McDade campaign. My stats say over seven hundred people signed the petition through the link in this page’s bio. I’ve now replaced it with a link for donations that will split each contribution across a number of organisations that fight racism and police brutality in the US. It would be great if those seven hundred clicks became seven hundred dollars. White followers, please donate if you haven’t already. It’s time to put our money where our mouth is.
