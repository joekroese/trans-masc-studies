Building a Male Body, article in Issue #79 of Transgender Tapestry, which came out in Summer 1997. Photos and text be Dean Kotula, with quotes from the photos’ subjects. [@transsexualwerewolf ](https://www.instagram.com/transsexualwerewolf/)tagged me in a post about Kotula which lead to this post

“Because I am an eternal boundary crosser, seeker of intangible degrees, I think I will always feel squeamish seeing my captured image on paper-for all that I am is fluid, changing, moving, reaching beyond the linear to connect with all life.”

Founded by Merissa Sherrill Lynn, Transgender Tapestry was a magazine published from the late 1970s to the early 2000s by the Tiffany Club and later by the International Foundation for Gender Education (IFGE). The publication went through several names changes including "The TV-TS Tapestry," "Tapestry," and "The Tapestry Journal." More information, and an archive of past issues can be found via the [Digital Transgender Archive](https://www.digitaltransgenderarchive.net/col/7w62f824d).
