**Amelio Robles Ávila** (3 November 1889 – 9 December 1984) fought in the Mexican Revolution, rose to the rank of colonel, and lived openly as a man from age 24 until his death at age 95. The below description is taken from Emerald Pellot’s article on Ávila for wearepitu.com

Amelio Robles Ávila was born to a wealthy family on November 3, 1889, in Xochipala, Guerrero. In his youth, Ávila attended a Catholic school. In 1911, when Ávila was arranged to be married to a man, he enlisted as a revolutionary instead. He legally changed his name to Amelio, cut his hair, and became one of Mexico’s most valuable and regarded revolutionaries. Ávila fought courageously in the war until its end. Becoming a Colonel with his own command, he was decorated with three stars by revolutionary general Emiliano Zapata. He led and won multiple pivotal battles where his identity and contributions were respected. However, that respect was sometimes earned through empathy other times through the whip of his pistol. Ávila was a man and anyone who chose to ignore this fact would be taught by force. On one occasion, when a group of men tried to “expose” him by tearing off his clothes, Ávila shot and killed two of the men.

While he was not the only person assigned female to adopt a male persona to join the war, unlike many others Ávila kept his name and lived as a man until the day he died. Unsurprisingly, Ávila was a bit of a ladies man, though he finally settled down with Angela Torres (seen in the final photo) and together they adopted their daughter Regula Robles Torres. In 1970, he was recognized by the Mexican Secretary of National Defense as a _veterano_ as opposed to a _veterana_ of the Mexican Revolution, thus Colonel Amelio Robles Ávila is considered the first trans soldier documented in Mexican military history.

After the war, Ávila was able to live comfortably as a man where he devoted his life to agriculture. Colonel Ávila died on December 9, 1984, aged 95.
