Pipás Pista (1886–1940) farm worker convicted of murder — found on my favourite website [zagria.blogspot.com](http://zagria.blogspot.com).

Note: In Hungarian/Magyar third person pronouns are not gendered. Ő is used whether the person is male or female, and will be used here for the protagonist, but, to avoid complication, only for the protagonist. The accusative, him-her, is őt; the possessive is övé.

Fődi Viktória was born in Átokháza (which actually means 'curse house') , 40 km east of Szeged in what is now southern Hungary. Ő was then married without övé consent to 46-year-old Reiger Pál, a wagon driver. As no dowry was provided, ő was regarded as a sort of unpaid domestic servant.

In 1910, ő left him. Ő flattened övé breasts with rags and straps, wore male clothing and gave övé name as Pipás Pista (Pista is a nickname derived from Istvan or Steven, and Pipás is a pipe smoker). Ő travelled around the Great Hungarian Plain doing male jobs such as plowing, sowing, harvesting and slaughtering pigs. Ő was primarily employed by widows or wives whose husband was not able to work. Because of övé very strong physique and strength, ö was famous in the area, had a separate table in the local Dog Scraper Tavern, and was said to have cut many men to the ground with one hand. Farmers in the area were happy to hire ö as a day laborer because of övé incredible carrying capacity, ö was said to be able to work twice as much as others.

While working on farms, ö began working as a hit man for farmers wives. As divorce was not an option for them, they would hire ö to ‘get rid’ of their abusive husbands. Pipás would stage murders to look like suicides. It is unrecorded how many husbands ö killed. Ö was arrested in June 1932, and sentenced to death — ö was then pardoned, but died in prison in 1940 suffering from emphysema and myocardial degeneration.
