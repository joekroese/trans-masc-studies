Summary of the 60s regarding transgender milestones, printed in the Winter 2002 issue of Transgender Tapestry. It includes a section on Reed Erickson, and on transgender surgeries. 

Founded by Merissa Sherrill Lynn, Transgender Tapestry was a magazine published from the late 1970s to the early 2000s by the Tiffany Club and later by the International Foundation for Gender Education (IFGE). The publication went through several names changes including "The TV-TS Tapestry," "Tapestry," and "The Tapestry Journal." More information, and an archive of past issues can be found via the [Digital Transgender Archive](https://www.digitaltransgenderarchive.net/col/7w62f824d).
