Saff Saffery, recently featured in Netflix documentary ‘Tiger King’ (2020). The documentary looks at Joe Exotic, a private zookeeper who runs Greater Wynwood Zoo, at which Saff worked for many years, before leaving in 2018.

Saffery was born in Hawaii. While enlisted in the Army, he was deployed to both Afghanistan and Iraq, and lost his parents during his enlistment. Having a passion for tigers since he was a child, it made sense to end up working with them in his adult life, working at owner Joe Exotic’s park and caring for some of the larger cats.

Saffery did end up getting damage from the tigers when he attempted to stick his hand in the tiger cage in order to close the door in 2013, rather than using a stick. Because of this, a tiger hurt his hand, and he was sent to the OU Medical Center in Oklahoma City to get his hand looked at and cared for. He decided that the damage was too much and instead of going through two years of various reconstructive surgeries, he opted to amputate his arm and has since been hoping to receive a prosthetic one. He returned to the park and his job eleven days later.

Saffery was consistently misgendered during the Tiger King documentary.
