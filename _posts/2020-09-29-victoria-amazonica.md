Victoria Amazonica (sometimes known as Victoria Regia) is a species of flowering plant, the largest of the Nymphaeaceae family of water lilies. It is the national flower of Guyana. 

The species’ flowers are short-lived and last about 48 hours, appearing as white when it opens, initially as female. The sweet scent they emit attracts beetles which carry pollen from other plants. After the transfer of the pollen, the flower shuts as fertilization takes place to trap the beetles inside. When the flower opens the next evening, after transforming to mature male during the day, the beetles fly to a different white flower. After this process, the flower closes up descending below the water surface. The flowers grow up to 40 centimetres wide — the leaves up to 3 meters.

The first published description of the genus was by John Lindley in October 1837, based on specimens of this plant returned from British Guiana by Robert Schomburgk.
