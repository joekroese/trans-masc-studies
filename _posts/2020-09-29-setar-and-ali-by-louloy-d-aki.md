Setar and Ali are bacha posh. Bacha posh (literally "dressed up as a boy”) is a practice in Afghanistan in which families without cisgender sons will assign male gender to newborns and raise them as a son. Daughters are often considered as a burden, while a son will earn money, carry on the family legacy and stay home to care for their aging parents. Bacha posh can go outside alone, work, play sports, etc. Their lives get more difficult as they hit puberty and stop ‘passing’ as boys, but many still don’t transition into life as women. For example, Ali and Setar’s parents want them to start dressing and behaving like girls to avoid harassment, but neither of the children want to.

‘Now Setar is a 16-year-old who plays football and has a girlfriend who doesn’t care about gender. Ali, 14, has a box of love letters written by female admirers. At home, neither get up to help when their sisters and mother make meals and tea.’ - [Inside the Lives of Girls Dressed as Boys in Afghanistan](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/photography/proof/2018/march/bacha-posh-gender-afghanistan/), by Nina Strochlic for National Geographic.
