**_Le Roman de Silence_** is an Old French _roman_ in octosyllabic verse, dated to the first half of the 13th century. It is attributed to one _Heldris de Cornuälle._ The single manuscript holding the text was found in 1911 in Wollaton Hall in Nottingham, in a crate marked "unimportant documents”.

The narrative concerns the adventures of _Cador_, the heir of the Earl of Cornwall, and then of his child _Silence_, who is raised as a boy in order to be eligible to inherit, as the Evan, the King of England, has outlawed the succession of women. At the age of twelve, Mother Nature appears to Silence to chastise him for hiding his biology. Silence is almost convinced until Nurture arrives and debates with Nature. Reason then appears, and makes silence see that he is better off as a man, but he remains unsure.

Silence runs away with two minstrels, with whom he works and travels with for four years. He returns to Cador’s court, and is chosen to be a retainer to the king. The Queen attempts to seduce Silence, but he rejects her. Hurt, she accuses Silence of assaulting her, and so King Evan sends him to the King of France. The Queen attempts to get Silence executed, but her plan fails.

Upon returning to England for battle, the Queen again attempts to seduce Silence, and is rebuffed. In her rage, the Queen asks for Silence to capture the wizard Merlin, who must be caught by ‘the trick of a woman’. When Silence catches Merlin, Merlin outs him to the king, disproving the Queens assault accusations. The King executes the Queen, strips Silence of male clothing, changes the name Silence to Silentia, and Silentia becomes the new Queen.
