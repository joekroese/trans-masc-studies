# Trans Masc Studies Website

Trans Masc Studies is a project by [Izzy Kroese](https://www.izzykroese.co.uk/) that focuses on researching masculine-leaning gender variance throughout history and culture. The project started as an Instagram account at [@transmascstudies](https://www.instagram.com/transmascstudies/). This project houses the code for the project's evolution into a website at [transmascstudies.com](https://transmascstudies.com).

## Quickstart

If you want to create a local version of the website,

```
git clone git@github.com:radicaldataproject/transmascstudies.com.git
cd transmascstudies
bundle i
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

## Credits

The website is based on the Jekyll Grid Portfolio Theme. To see an example of that theme, have a look at [jonathanmatthey.com](http://jonathanmatthey.com).
